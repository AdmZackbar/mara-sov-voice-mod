<h1>Mara Sov - Voice [WOTC]</h1>
<p>This is a fairly basic voice pack for Mara Sov (Kirsten Potter) of Destiny that adds about 350+ unique lines of dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: most of the lines were AI generated, which might be distasteful for some. However, I think that in general they hold up well, and ultimately there would be no way to make a complete pack for her without the use of this technique.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>This pack currently adds 1 new voice: Mara Sov (Radio). This voice includes a basic radio filter to match that of all default voices, and can be used with all females: basic soldiers, hero soldiers, and SPARKs. It contains 357 unique lines (with some lines being used for multiple cases where appropriate).</p>
<p>This mod is also cooked, which has drastically reduced the size to just around 3 MB.</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>I can't think of a reason why this mod would be incompatible with any others (like most voice pack mods).</p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<p>When I generated the output audio files with the radio filter, I also generated clean ones as well. Given that some mods include both the radio and the clean voices, I may end up adding that second voice to this pack. In addition, some lines are definitely better than others, and I may end up regenerating some of the worse ones as I see fit. I also might add additional lines to some of the more common use cases. I will not, however, remove or drastically alter existing content.</p>
<p>There are some voice cues that go unused in the base game, but are utilized by some mods. I would like to support all those cues eventually.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>Some of the lines might sound a bit 'off' due to their generated nature. I'll try to improve those ones over time.</p>
<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>You are free to use the contents of this mod as you see fit. While the ripped audio from the game is fair game, I have not obtained express permission from the V.A. to replicate her voice. As a result, if I am contacted to take this mod down, I will of course comply. I will say that this mod was created for the love of the game and the character, with no infringement being intended!</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>I started making this mod because I needed a side project, was curious if AI voice generation could be used for something like this, and it combines 2 games that I play a lot. However the real reasons why this mod exists are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bungie: the creators of the Destiny IP and being willing to allow creations such as this.</li>
<li>Kirsten Potter: Mara's amazing voice actor and on whom the AI voice model was based on.</li>
<li>ElevenLabs: the service I used to generate the majority of the voice lines.</li>
<li>Audacity: the application I processed a lot of the audio files with.</li>
<li>Robojumper: for his guide and scripts on creating voice packs.</li>
<li>Stupidpupil: for the <a href="https://github.com/stupidpupil/voicepack_template">template for Robojumper's script</a>.</li>
<li>Iridar: for his guide on how to properly cook assets (how this mod doesn't take up a ton of space).</li>
<li>So many more modders that have made XCOM such a replayable game for me and many others.</li>
</ul>
