# Mara Sov - Voice \[WOTC\]

This is a fairly basic voice pack for Mara Sov (Kirsten Potter) of Destiny that adds about 350+ unique lines of dialogue. This mod is only for the WOTC expansion.

**DISCLAIMER**: most of the lines were AI generated, which might be distasteful for some. However, I think that in general they hold up well, and ultimately there would be no way to make a complete pack for her without the use of this technique.

## Contents

This pack currently adds 1 new voice: Mara Sov (Radio). This voice includes a basic radio filter to match that of all default voices, and can be used with all females: basic soldiers, hero soldiers, and SPARKs. It contains 357 unique lines (with some lines being used for multiple cases where appropriate).

This mod is also cooked, which has drastically reduced the size to just around 3 MB.

For the full breakdown of voice lines, see [this file](CONTENT.md).

## Compatibility

I can't think of a reason why this mod would be incompatible with any others (like most voice pack mods).

## Future Work

When I generated the output audio files with the radio filter, I also generated clean ones as well. Given that some mods include both the radio and the clean voices, I may end up adding that second voice to this pack. In addition, some lines are definitely better than others, and I may end up regenerating some of the worse ones as I see fit. I also might add additional lines to some of the more common use cases. I will not, however, remove or drastically alter existing content.

There are some voice cues that go unused in the base game, but are utilized by some mods. I would like to support all those cues eventually.

## Known Issues

Some of the lines might sound a bit 'off' due to their generated nature. I'll try to improve those ones over time.

## Permissions

You are free to use the contents of this mod as you see fit. While the ripped audio from the game is fair game, I have not obtained express permission from the V.A. to replicate her voice. As a result, if I am contacted to take this mod down, I will of course comply. I will say that this mod was created for the love of the game and the character, with no infringement being intended!

## Credits

I started making this mod because I needed a side project, was curious if AI voice generation could be used for something like this, and it combines 2 games that I play a lot. However the real reasons why this mod exists are the following:

* Bungie: the creators of the Destiny IP and being willing to allow creations such as this.
* Kirsten Potter: Mara's amazing voice actor and on whom the AI voice model was based on.
* ElevenLabs: the service I used to generate the majority of the voice lines.
* Audacity: the application I processed a lot of the audio files with.
* Robojumper: for his guide and scripts on creating voice packs.
* Stupidpupil: for the [template for Robojumper's script](https://github.com/stupidpupil/voicepack_template).
* Iridar: for his guide on how to properly cook assets (how this mod doesn't take up a ton of space).
* So many more modders that have made XCOM such a replayable game for me and many others.
